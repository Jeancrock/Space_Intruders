Space Intruders is a clone of Space Invaders.

A wave of enemies moves from left to right in a jerky motion. Once the rightmost enemy reaches the edge, they all move down in a step and head back to the left, where they will do the same. All enemies in this wave can shoot, and if they reach the ground, the player loses the game. Some enemies have more than one HP. A bonus ship may appear once per wave.

The player can fire up to 5 bullets at the same time. Each hit on the player takes away one life. the goal is to destroy all the enemies.
